# Signaling Help

First thing you can do on the Martin 16 is to call the Chase Boat on the VHF Radio. If that doesnâ€™t work you can signal for help by lowering your mainsail. This will make you less visible at a distance but once the Chase Boat sees you they will come over to determine why your sail is down. Next try calling the Dock Leader on your cellphone. If none of these methods work, you can dial 911 and explain your predicament and they will either send the Harbor Patrol or the Coast Guard.

If the Chase Boat is within view but not answering your radio call you can simply raise your arms and begin to wave them slowly overhead, which is an international sign of distress. You may attract a boat that is not affiliated with Challenged Sailors San Diego. If the situation is dire enough then allow them to render assistance or attempt to call for assistance.

## VHF Radio

In emergency situations there are three phrases that you might hear on a VHF radio:

**MAYDAY** - distress signal requires the most urgent response. This signal is only to be used when a person or boat is threatened by grave or imminent danger, and requires assistance.

**PAN-PAN** - (pronounced pahn-pahn) used to signal urgent information, like when someone has fallen overboard, or a boat is drifting into shore or a busy shipping channel. If your emergency isn't immediately life threatening, say Pan-Pan instead of Mayday,

**SECURITE** - (pronounced sea-cur-i-tay) is the safety signal. This is used to transmit information about the safety of navigation.
