According to the U.S. Coast Guard, should your boat come in contact with a power line, don't jump into the water. The electrical charge may pass through your boat and electrify the surrounding water. The safest approach is to stay in the boat and avoid touching anything metal. Leave the boat only after it has moved away from the line.

It's not just on the water where power lines can be dangerous. BoatUS claim files show that other boats have hit power lines while at launch ramps. A few years ago a Seaworthy editor was pulling his 22-foot sailboat out of a boat ramp at a small lake in Washington state after a sail with his family. He brought the boat to the staging area to lower the mast and prep the boat for the road when he was startled to hear what sounded like angry bees near the top of his mast. The sound it turned out was not from angry bees, but an angry high-voltage line that was not far from the top of the boat's aluminum mast. The boat was quickly moved away from the power line and the mast lowered. If anyone had been touching the mast and the electricity jumped from the line, they could have been electrocuted. The small-boat ramp was not designed with sailboats in mind; a boat with even a slightly taller mast could have created a disaster.

Look up and carefully scan the area for power lines before raising your mast — and don't forget to check again as you bring the boat out of the water. Older launch ramps are more likely to have low power lines that can snag an unwary sailor.

Apply the same rules used at home for internal electrical systems on boats. Turn off the circuit if you plan on working on an electrical circuit.

For boats large enough to “Bond” the mast, rigging, lifelines, motor, and electrical system ground should be tied to an external zinc electrode. Do not tie hot AC return or even a DC return to the Zinc since it is possible to electrify the water immediately around the boat making it dangerous for swimmers. Bonding the boat’s metal to an external zinc can reduce electrolysis of certain metals onboard as well as direct a lightning strike’s current to the water via the zinc electrode.

To complete connections between these components for the purpose of bonding, the conductors should be a minimum of #8 AWG. If doing double duty as a lightning-protection system, they must be a minimum of #6 AWG.
