# Slowing or Stopping

Usually we want our boat to sail quickly, but sometimes it is useful to slow the boat when trying to avoid an obstacle.

## Practice Upwind

_**How to Slow Down When Sailing Upwind:**_

Start sailing close-hauled. Let out one or both sails so that they luff, and your boat will slow down.

## Practice Downwind

_**How To Slow Down When Sailing Downwind:**_
Start sailing on a broad reach. Head your boat up toward the wind, keeping your sails out so they luff, and your boat will slow down.

## Practice Downwind When Cannot Alter Course

_**How To Slow Down When Sailing Downwind If You Cannot Alter Course:**_
Start sailing on a broad reach. Pull in both sails so they are over the centerline of your boat (pulled in tight). The boat will slow because your sails will be over-trimmed, and not catching the wind properly.

## Practice Stopping

_**How to Stop the Boat:**_

Start sailing on any heading. Then head to a close reach and luff your sails completely in the safety position.
IMPORTANT: In order to slow the boat when making a downwind or crosswind docking, it is usually necessary to drop the mainsail, and fully luff the jib. The companion sailor may also need to drag a paddle in the water to slow or stop the boat.
