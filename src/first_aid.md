# First Aid

When sailing as a Companion or Participant, you will be exposed to the elements wind, water, and sun. These elements create conditions that are called ‘exposure’ and lead to taxing of the body’s regulatory systems. This can lead to exhaustion, hypothermia, or hyperthermia.

Both Companions and Participants should be aware of their limitations and when its apparent the limits are getting close, it’s time to go back to the dock. Don’t forget it takes time to return to the East end of Harbor Island, reach the channel entrance, and sail up the channel and fairway to reach the dock.

Once it’s evident that the Participant is experiencing being chilled, or overheated begin to treat immediately with what’s at hand. Heaving to can be done in order to don a jacket or remove a layer (and immediately don the lifejacket again) should be done. If that resolves the problem and the participant decides to continue to sail, the Companion should insist that the Participant sail in the vicinity of Harbor Island’s East End. If the Participant begins to experience symptoms of exposure again then it’s time to head in. Contact the Chase Boat on VHF that you’re heading back to the dock. The CB will follow you up the channel to ensure safe passage to the Dock.

If Dock Support is available the CB will then head back out to continue escorting the other Martin 16s out, or if no Dock Support is standing by, the CB will act as Dock Support until its determined that the Participant is fine or receiving the assistance needed.

Other aid that can be rendered on the water is providing water to anyone that is dehydrated, application of sunblock, and putting band aids on cuts. If more serious problems present themselves don’t hesitate to use the VHF to notify the Chase Boat. If it’s possible to sail back safely then do so, otherwise arrange to be towed. If the problem is extreme then use Channel 16 to notify the Coast Guard.
