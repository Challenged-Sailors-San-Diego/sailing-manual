# Line Handling

The Martin 16 is designed to ‘gang sheet’ the sails (trimming both sails by pulling both sheets in the same hand together). This allows the Power Adapter Unit to use one motor and two spools to control the Jib and Main sheets at the same time.

All lines are led to the cockpit in easy reach from the front seat. The heavy keel and smaller sail plan means the most common error in sheeting is having the sheets in too tight, slowing the boat. It is recommended that you mark the deck half way between the mast and the gunnel and set the Jib at that point to sail upwind. If others are sailing as fast but higher than you it is probably that you are not letting the inner jib telltales to lift, especially on puffs. In winds above 15 knots you may find the Martin moves quickly upwind with the inner jib telltales pointing nearly straight up!

From a broad reach to a beat, check your jib luff and main leech telltales frequently to ensure they are flowing. If any of the outside jib or main’s leech telltales are drooping or flowing forward then your sails are stalled and you need to let sails out or possibly head up to reestablish flow.
