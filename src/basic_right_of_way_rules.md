# Basic Right of Way Rules

Be courteous, and avoid possible collisions!

## Port–Starboard rule

Port-tack boat must keep clear of the starboard tack boat

## Windward-Leeward rule

Windward boat must keep clear of a leeward boat on the same tack

## Clear astern - Clear ahead

Overtaking boat must keep clear of a boat clear ahead, whether it is a sailboat or a powerboat

## The boat with the least maneuverability has right of way

Usually boats under power need to keep clear of boats under sail. However, large naval or commercial ships have limited maneuverability, so smaller recreational boats need to keep clear of them. Also, small boats should give a large boat in a narrow channel adequate room to maneuver.

## Right and Left Drift

Get used to observing boats that present a concern for possible collision and sighting their position relative to your boat. Keep checking occasionally if their relative position for right or left drift. If another vessel is on a Constant Bearing with Decreasing Range (CBDR) then a potential collision exists. This can be avoided by simply changing your course or heading to pass astern of the other vessel.

## Telegraphing Your Intentions to Pass (Port or Starboard)

When approaching a vessel, that is nearly dead ahead, it is important to keep the bow of your boat to one side of the other vessel’s bow. Avoid allowing your bow to wander to the right and left of the other vessel’s bow since this will confuse that vessel’s helms person or skipper as to your intentions. If the other vessels skipper is experienced then they will keep their bow pointed to one side of your bow also ‘telegraphing’ their intention to pass to one side of your bow. If you find a vessel approaching that keeps veering right and left of your bow it may indicate they are inexperienced or distracted and you should make a course change to avoid passing close to the other vessel.

### By determining early the right of way situation for the boats closest to your boat and monitoring their course and drift you can prevent situations that require you to make any drastic course changes to avoid a collision. Telegraph your intentions early with other boats coming towards your bow, and monitor the drift of boats closest to you. Always cross astern of large vessels that are working, must stay in a channel, especially ferries, harbor patrol boats, and vessels towing or fishing. Early monitoring and action will lead to an uneventful sail. Do not assume that as a sailboat you automatically have right-a-way over power boats. Know your right-a-way rules but know that the most important rule is “Avoid a collision.”
