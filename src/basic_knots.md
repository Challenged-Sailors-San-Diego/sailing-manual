# Basic Knots

In order to understand an explanation on how to tie a knot some basic knot vocabulary is needed:

Line anatomy – Line typically has two ends the ‘Standing Part’ (or end) which is where the line is attached to a load (e.g., a boat) and the ‘Bitter End’ the free end that is not attached to a load. A ‘bight’ is formed when a line’s “tail” is doubled over.

A ‘Bend’ generally refers to a knot used to tie two lines together, while a ‘hitch’ generally refers to tying a line to an object or to itself. However like English for every rule there’re lots of exceptions.

Typical line types seen in boating are:
· 3-Strand used for dock lines and tow lines. It’s the easiest to splice.
· Double Braid used for running rigging
· Plaited line is used for anchor rode.
· Hollow Braid is used with polypropylene life
lines attached to Rescue Rings for throwing to persons in the water. Polypropylene will float making it easier to see in the water.
Some Basic Knots:

1. Figure Eight – Sometimes referred to as a stopper knot, it makes a knot that won’t slip out. Tied with a bight it also forms a secure, non-slip loop at the end of a rope. It’s a common knot used by mountain climbers, but comes in handy for securing to a mooring.

line around an object. It can also be used to join two ropes together. Put a bight in the second half of the square knot and you have a slipped reef knot.

line. It’s a knot that won’t jam and can be untied even under extreme
tension. As long as it’s under constant load the bowline won’t slip,
but under an intermittent load it can fail if the ‘bitter end’ is too short.

It’s not a stable knot and will come undone under too much, or too little, load but it’s a very handy for organizing and setting several lines you’re working with.

8. Trucker’s Hitch - One of the most versatile knots there is, not just for boating but in many outdoor activities. Don’t let the video intimidate you, it’s quick and easy. It’s a great knot for securing equipment into position and it utilizes a quick release to make unloading/changing out items efficient and simple. 1(a) Or some sailors have gone to the Alpine Butterfly Loop used the same way but much easier to untie after being under load.

9. Alpine Butterfly Knot - The butterfly loop, also known as lineman's loop, butterfly knot, alpine butterfly knot, Swiss loop and lineman's rider, is a knot used to form a fixed loop in the middle of a rope. One advantage is it unties easily after a load than a slip knot when used in a truckers hitch.
