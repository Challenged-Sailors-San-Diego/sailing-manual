# Dressing for Hot or Cold

The essentials for what to wear sailing are most likely clothes you already have lying around at home, with a few important extras that you might want to consider making sailing a really enjoyable experience.

## Practice

We’ll start with the miserable sailing gear and get to the fun stuff at the end! Although you don’t want to consider that it might rain on your sailing adventure, you’ll be even more upset if it comes and you aren’t prepared.

Sailing only really happens when it’s windy, and when it’s windy you get cold, and when it’s wet and windy you can get REALLY cold. Not great on a sailboat that doesn’t have heating!

You want a really decent raincoat when you’re sailing, so that if the worst does happen you can still enjoy it.

Get a waterproof jacket that’s also wind breaker. Even when it isn’t raining you can still get really cold when you’re out sailing, and a wind breaker jacket can make all the difference. As someone who used to sniff at ‘wind proof’ gear, Experience has made me a convert, and I don’t sail with anything less.

Make sure it also has a hood. You will be so thankful for that, especially if there is spray coming over the boat. No one wants cold seawater running down their back on a rainy day!

If you’re sailing in the height of summer, in occasional spray or rain, then waterproof trousers might be a little overkill. Still grabbing a cheap pair of waterproof trousers is recommended, just in case. Sailing is so much more comfortable when you have the right clothes for it.

The best way to deal with the changing weather while you’re sailing is to be prepared with lots of layers of sailing clothes. It can be bathing suit weather one minute and freezing cold the next.

Always bring a t-shirt, a long-sleeved top (preferably a thermal vest), a fleece top and then your raincoat that’s windproof as your final layer. The fleece top is the perfect sort of layer for sailing as it’s light and breathable, but will also keep you super warm.
