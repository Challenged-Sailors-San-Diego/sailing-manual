5 Things to Consider Regarding Weather

BY: ASA LEARN TO SAIL, SAILBOATS, WEATHER

At the core of all we do as sailors is one thing – weather. It’s is our engine, our bliss or our most frightening adversary. Let’s start with the basic ideas surrounding weather. Here’s a little list of things to think about as it pertains to weather.

## Check the Weather

The first thing to always remember is to simply check the marine weather forecast before leaving the dock. Of course, this is obvious, but so many sailors look out the window, see the sun, raise the main and off they go. The VHF has a dedicated channel that continually plays the weather forecast, and you can find National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) local predictions for your area on the Web.

## Watch the Waves

The behavior of the waves will tell a sailor quite a bit. Not all of us have anemometers but we all can keep our eyes on what’s happening with wave action and understand how much wind is present. Knowing the speed of the wind is important in determining the proper sail trim. Here’s what to look for:

5-knots of wind creates small wavelets in the water.

10-knots of wind scattered whitecaps appear.

15-knots the wind forms significant waves – many of them with breaking tops.

20-knots the wind begins to kick up spray and life on the water can get a bit more intense.
And, don’t forget another source for waves, Power Boat Wakes, Be Aware and Take on Wakes at a 45 to 60 degree Angle!

## Dress for Success

Always keep or bring clothing that accommodates a change in weather. Dress in layers, it’s easy to look outside, in El Cajon, see a burning sun and forget that the Marine Layer can have San Diego Bay socked in with clouds. Being underdressed can compromise the mission. Have the right clothes and keep them on hand so your day on the water is comfortable!
