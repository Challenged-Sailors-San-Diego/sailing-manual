# Adjusting and Depowering Sails

Depowering a sailboat generally starts with setting the outhaul tightly or putting in a snug “Flattening Reef” to flatten the bottom half of the Mainsail. Followed by setting the Jib sheet cars aft to flatten the bottom half of the Jib. This reduces the draft on both sails and opens the slot between Jib and Main. The Main can be further depowered by easing the vang to allow the top half of the main to twist off and spill excess wind.

## Practice

On the Martin 16 the Outhaul can be tightened to flatten the lower half of the Main and the vang loosened to allow the Main to twist and spill excess wind in the top of the sail. The Jib Halyard can be set tighter to pull the Mast bending it forward further flattening the Main but not so tight the aft end of the Jib Boom drags on the deck.

The Main Halyard should be set tight enough to set a vertical wrinkle in the Main’s Luff which will relax some once underway and can be adjusted with the Cunningham.

Once underway in a breeze it’s important not to over sheet the Jib and in a beat to trim the Main so the back half of the second batten above the boom is kept parallel to the boat’s centerline. Some air will be spilled out of the top of the Main which reduces heel while still maintaining hull speed on a beat or close reach.

Over sheeting will hook the lower Main Sail battens to windward slowing the boat and will close off the slot between Jib and Main reducing the power down low on the main. Excessive heel will generate more leeway affecting course over the ground on a beat. So let the sails breathe by not over sheeting. Use the telltales to point as high as possible with proper trim, allowing the inner telltales to lift and the Main’s Leech telltales to ‘flutter’ while streaming.

Remember the Martin 16 was developed to sail on Canadian waters where higher winds are frequent so the boat sails well when heeled over up to 29 degrees, and the Martin 16 was designed to be able to sail heeled up to 30 degrees and not swamp from heeling. So relax, don’t over sheet, and enjoy windy days on the water!
