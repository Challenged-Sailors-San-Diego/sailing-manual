# Stowing Sails

On today’s sailboats the sailor is handling a wide variety of sail materials from Dacron polyester with coatings to reduce porosity improving performance to Genoas made of a mylar substrate supporting carbon fibers run along computer generated stress lines. All of these sail types are best preserved by stowing them away from the Sun’s UV light, keeping them dry, and covered to avoid collecting dust.

One thing that sailors can do to maximize the life and performance of these sails is never to intentionally crease them. DO NOT FOLD YOUR SAILS! Sails will perform best and last the longest if they are rolled and not folded.

## Practice

When putting the Martin 16 sails away:

- Pull the head of the jib or main down to foot of the sail avoiding creasing the middle of the sail.
- Roll the sails loosely from its middle to the foot, use a tube along the center of the Mainsail
  and roll the sail being careful to keep the tube parallel to the battens.
  (Why not roll from the foot to the head? You can, the difference is the convenience of rigging the boat the next. When the sails are rolled from the middle then the head, tack, and clew can be attached without unrolling the sail. Once the halyard, tack and clew are attached and the boom mounted on the gooseneck, the sail can then be hoisted to unfurl it.)
- Once both Main and Jib are rolled then put them together and slide them into the sailbag with the same number. All hulls, sails, and sailbags are numbered.

When you stow sails, they should not be set against or on anything that can corrode or rust as this can cause serious damage to a sail. NEVER DRAG A SAIL ACROSS CONCRETE since this can damage the sail and any coatings applied. Dacron sails made more porous allows wind to go through the sail material rather to being deflected by the sail. Mylar sails are also sensitive to chafe causing damage to the high strength, low stretch fibers glued to the surface of the Mylar substrate.

Stowed sails should be covered and protected from dust, chafe, and UV light.

You will find that even on larger boats when sails are stowed, more and more they are being rolled and placed in long zippered sail bags which are passed below and placed in a bunk or on the floor to allow them to lay out with no folds. The only sails that are stowed in a bag in a wadded condition are spinnakers due to their large size and material that does not lend itself to rolling.
